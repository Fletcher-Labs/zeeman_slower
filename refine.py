# Attempt to refine the output from the optimization code, specifically
# the initial and end section

# Input: final (lengths and currents) from optimization
# First, we are going to loosen restrictions on initial sections, so 
# instead of strict density sections like [0, 0.25, 0.5, 1] and the 
# corresponding coil windings, we can just add and subtract whole coils from 
# a location.
